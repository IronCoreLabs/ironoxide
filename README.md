IronOxide is an SDK for accessing IronCore's privacy platform. It is appropriate for both client and server applications.

## Usage

To include IronOxide in your Rust application, see https://crates.io/crates/ironoxide for the most recent version.

If you are not building a Rust application, you might be interested in one of these SDKs:

- [ironoxide-java](https://github.com/IronCoreLabs/ironoxide-java) - Java bindings for ironoxide. Appropriate for all JVM languages.
- [ironoxide-scala](https://github.com/IronCoreLabs/ironoxide-scala) - Scala wrappers around `ironoxide-java`.
- [ironnode](https://github.com/IronCoreLabs/ironnode) - NodeJS implementation of IronCore's Privacy Platform.
- [ironweb](https://github.com/IronCoreLabs/ironweb) - Javascript implementation of IronCore's Privacy Platform. Appropriate for all modern browsers.

All SDKs are intended to be compatible with one another.

#### Building

Rust (stable) and [libstd](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/) required.

`cargo build`

It may be possible to build with `no_std`, but we haven't looked at this.
We test on a variety of architectures (including Linux-x86_64 MacOSX-x86_64, IOS-aarch64, Android-aarch64), and should generally work anywhere Rust stable works.

#### Running Unit Tests

IronCore has integration tests that are not runnable by the public. If you are interested in the results, [CI runs the integration tests (every test file with *_ops in its name)](https://github.com/IronCoreLabs/ironoxide/actions/workflows/ci.yaml). If you think you need to run the integration tests on a development machine, please open an issue.

To run the unit test suite, use:

`cargo t --lib`
